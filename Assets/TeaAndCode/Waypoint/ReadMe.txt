Thanks for purchasing Waypoint.

INSTALLATION
======================================================================================
Once installed, a new menu item appears in the Tools dropdown as Waypoint Editor.
Selecting the Waypoint Editor opens a new window for creating Waypoints. A button
should appear to create a new waypoint setup. The setup needs to happen once per
scene.

I recommend placing the Waypoint Editor window as one of the tabs on the right
column by the default inspector location. The Help button opens up the documentation
in the default browser and should take you the rest of the way.


FULL-DETAIL DOCUMENTATION
======================================================================================
The full documentation is located in Assets\TeaAndCode\Waypoint\Help\Help.htm.
You can also access it through the Help button. It includes the information for
the available options and tutorials to help you get started.
